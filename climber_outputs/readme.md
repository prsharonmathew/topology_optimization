This folder contains the outputs generated for a 2D walker.

Folder: plots_actuationsignal contains the plots candidate actuation signal vs time for all chosen particles.

Folder: plots_desvar_iteration contains the plots design variables v\s number of iterations for the chosen particles.

Folder: simulations contains the the optimized layout of the soft body after certain number of iterations.

File: plot_final_config.png is the final optimized layout of the soft body.

File: plot_objective_constraints_vs_iteration.png is the plot of objectvive function and const penalties over iterations.
